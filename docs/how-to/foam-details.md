# Foam

Hey,

Thank you so much for considering to contribute to our projects. We use [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) to manage our Knowledge base. 

We are assuming that you are somewhat fluent with GitHub and VS Code.

1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.
2. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.

    *Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item.*

3. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)

After setting up the repository, head to [getting started](./getting-started.md) to get familiar with your new knowledge base!

If you have reached till here, That means you are done with all the initial setup and are ready to contribute to our knowledge base. But if you are not, Feel free to email us at hello@pravritti.org. Please mention [Contributor] in your subject line to prioritize your query.
